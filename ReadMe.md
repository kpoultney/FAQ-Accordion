### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I began the challenge by coding my HTML. Once the bones of the website were there, I began the design process in CSS to match the outline provided by the challenge. After ensuring the website design matched the brief, I began to add Javascript functionality to include the event listeners required to toggle the buttons. From there, I made small design adjustments to ensure the site was responsive when scaled down for a mobile device. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This challenge certainly reminded me not to overthink the solution. Sometimes simplest is better without having to get to indepth to achieve the same end result. 

### Useful resources

As always, thank you to the users on Stack Overflow who contribute their time and code to help newbies like me.
